## Life is dumber than a fairytale

When I was a kid and read the story about The Emperor's new Clothes, I asked myself how can people be so dumb. Can't they not tell the king is not wearing any cloth? This story is very stupid and it is just dumb story to fool a child. However, as I grow older, I have witness many real life example that is just like dumb people in The Emperor's new Clothes story who believe only smart people can see the "most beautiful cloth in the world". 

I usually like to express my opinions on the design/price value of a cloth to my friends while I am shopping in a mall. I am not a artist by all means so my opinion maybe wrong or naïve. It is funny if the cloth I am judging is from a cheap store or non-famous brand, my friends usually agree with my criticism sometimes even laugh with me at the same time. However, once we enter into a store that selling high end clothing or a famous brand store. My criticism will not be very received. They usually say that I have no taste, or you just saying that because you can not afford this cloth. It is funny a same ugly cloth can have two completely different reviews depends on who produce the product.

I think most people can be blinded by the fame of a person or a brand. If a brand is a luxury brand, people usually have trouble to criticize that product. Even that product looks hideous or way overpriced.  

If a person is somewhat famous or well-known, it is very easy for people to believe that person's opinion. Even when the opinion is clearly wrong and can be point out by a kid. 

Life will be so much better when we remove all the extra brand on a person/product.
