### TL;DR
#### I am going to change my life style 

Yesterday I have just finished my final exam which I think did pretty well. I waited nervously until midnight and the marks came out for three of my exams. Surprisingly enoughI passed ECE318 and ECE356 which I thought I did really bad on the final exam. After realize I officially finished my 3B term I have been think about what I would like to change in my future work term as well as setting goals for myself to find a better job in the next co-op and future full-time job.

## Eat

I have never had a chance to eat health. Although most of time I can make my own food, I always go for the easy way make some quick delicious but unhealthy food. My favourite food is pasta with meat and salary. I decided to change in the next 4 month. I am going to use a smoothie machine to make health vegetable and fruit smoothie. Use slow cooker to make meet and vegetable so that when I get home from work I something to eat rather than buying food from outside. My body is little bit over-weight and I think I could make it better in the next few month.

## Work out

I have been wanting to work out since 8 month ago. I did some running and went to some gym but I am having trouble to keep it up for more than 3 weeks. I purposely found a apartment with a free gym inside so that I wouldn't have any excuse of not going(too cold, or money) It is easy to go to gym for two days, or even a week but in order to make some real change to my body I have to commit to myself and keep going to gym. I think I can do it

## Study

I am not very smart compare to many people I met in my class at UW. This is good because I can see my limit. I have wanted to do coding question but all I did before is justing doing simple question and look at the answer of hard question. I have start coding in University compare to other who may start coding in elementary school. I have set myself several goal to improve my coding skill in the next 4 month of internship. It is going to be hard for me since I always want to relax myself after a hard day of work. But the interviews I had with google really crashed me that give a reminder of how far I am from a good developer. Without the right coding mind, it is going to be difficult for me to solve hard coding questions. Thus, I finally going to read the book a bought 2 years ago and study some data science in python. 


### I am going to blog during the next 4 month, try to keep my goals.
