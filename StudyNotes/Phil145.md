I always thought philosophy is not a subject I would be enjoying studying since I mainly focusing on subjection relates to computer. However, after learning PHIL145(_Critical thinking_) it really clears many of my question about human biases and created scientific controversy. 


I read two books during the class (both are mandatory)
1. Created Scientific Controversies: Uncertainty and Bias in Science and Society -- Hacker David
2. How to lie with statistics - Darrell Huff

I am not going to lie. At the beginning of the class I decided not going to read the book, instead just going to the class and take notes from what professor think it is important (basically what's going to be on the exam)

However, after skipping three classes because of midterm weeks, I have to starting reading the book. 

## Points to remember from the first book

1.  While we're often not aware of it, our reasoning is predictably irrational:
    - We preference arguments and evidence that conform with prior belief (confirmation bias)
    - We are unduly influenced by what's easiest to recall (what's repeated most often)
    - We place too much confidence in our own abilities and too much emphasis on the evidence we remember (bad decision making)
    - We are not good at admitting our vulnerabilities to cognitive biases (our decision making isn't rational)
2.  With any arguments, we should reflect on the quality of the evidence being utilized, the extend to which it supports the conclusion and the possibility that competing explanations are better supported by available evidence
3.  Reliable argument evaluation is extremely hard work, only by carefully developing good critical thinking skills, learning to identify informal fallacies and becoming better informed can we hope to reach sensible judgements on complicated issues
4.  The appearance of __uncertainty__ within some scientific community may not represent actual __uncertainty__ 
5.  Magnifying __uncertainty__ is central to spreading public doubt. 
6.  It's easy to cherry-pick experts/data, people re complicated, including scientist, so we shouldn't be surprised that some defend conclusions that are regarded by the rest of the scientific community as implausible and without merit. If a large proportion of scientist all agree not he basic issue, then focusing attention not he exceptions is unreasonable (Majority is wrong does not work here)

### Three criteria to identify scientific controversy

1. Motivation: financial, religion, etc
2. alternative: should have a positive alternative
3. engagement: only talking to the public instead of publishing paper  = created controversy


### Real world created controversy

- Support to Vaccinations and autism
  - Solid evidences suggest no correlation between these two
  - No scientific article support vaccinations causes autism 

- Counter to Climate change: 
  - Answers are provided but ignored (problems with data, models etc)
  - The majority of climate science scepticism is directed simply towards undermining the prevailing view
  - Weak objection being repeated to mislead the public about the state of the science

- Support to Intellectual Design
  - Motive: Religious motivation
  - Alternative: Yes no sound Imperial evidence to support
  - Engagement: No polish peer review in science

- Counter to Genetically modified organism (GMO)
  - No evidence suggest human eat GMO food causes health issue
  - Engagement: only talks to the public spreading doubt instead of publish papers
  - Financial motive


What I learned from PHIL145 will help me identify created scientific controversy in the future. I think It is important for me and the public to have a critical thinking skills. Companies and Media are using created scientific controversy to fulfill their motivation. Children died because their parents believe vaccines causes autism. People died in hunger because their leader believe GMO food are bad for health. Since I cannot be a expert in every fields, I chose to believe in the majority of the scientific community.
