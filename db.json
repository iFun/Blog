Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have been busy during the first two weeks of my co-op. I will break down into categories.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Life\"><a href=\"#Life\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Life\"></a>Life</h2><p>I don’t believe in god, but I believe things happened for a reason. I did a stupid, awful thing after Christmas. After two days I slipped and fall which twisted my left ankle. Part of my ligament is broken. I was in lots of pain and canceled two chances of snowboarding. I had to go see doctors and took x-ray which cost me almost 600. I am actually relieved that I slipped because what I did this is probably least worst karma can happen to me. What I learned after my ankle sprain is that only your parents care about you from the bottom of their heart. People including me only cares about themselves which make sense because we are selfish. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Living\"><a href=\"#Living\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Living\"></a>Living</h2><p>This term I still co-op in Toronto, but I rented a most expensive room among all my co-ops and study terms(1200/month). Its near lake and near work. Before I lived in China town as well as other area which most of people who live their are poor. This time I am living with “rich” people which I assume they are. The differences are significant, the people I walked by looked more educated as well as dressed well. The environment are clean and nice. I am closer to work so I don’t have to take subway and waste time on transportation. I feel like I am living in a different world even thought it is still Toronto and I walked passed by this area countless time during previous co-ops. I just had a sauna and a nice swimming tonight, the equipment is even better than the one I had in University of Waterloo. However, I feel lonely after swim, usually I don’t feel lonely possible because I am most vulnerable after workout. I feel like it will be nice to have someone talk to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Work\"><a href=\"#Work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Work\"></a>Work</h2><p>This probably is my best work term so far. I got a macbook pro as well as standing desk which I always dreamed of. My supervisor is super nice and I had the privilege of designing something really awesome. Building stuff from scratch and have total authority of using what frameworks as well as working with other co-ops can really help me to learn from mistake and improve my communication skills.

This is good because I can see my limit. I have wanted to do coding question but all I did before is justing doing simple question and look at the answer of hard question. I have start coding in University compare to other who may start coding in elementary school. I have set myself several goal to improve my coding skill in the next 4 month of internship. It is going to be hard for me since I always want to relax myself after a hard day of work. But the interviews I had with google really crashed me that give a reminder of how far I am from a good developer. Without the right coding mind, it is going to be difficult for me to solve hard coding questions. Thus, I finally going to read the book a bought 2 years ago and study some data science in python. </p>\n<h3 id=\"I-am-going-to-blog-during-the-next-4-month-try-to-keep-my-goals\"><a href=\"#I-am-going-to-blog-during-the-next-4-month-try-to-keep-my-goals\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"I am going to blog during the next 4 month, try to keep my goals.\"></a>I am going to blog during the next 4 month, try to keep my goals.</h3>","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"TL-DR\"><a href=\"#TL-DR\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TL;DR\"></a>TL;DR</h3><h4 id=\"I-am-going-to-change-my-life-style\"><a href=\"#I-am-going-to-change-my-life-style\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"I am going to change my life style\"></a>I am going to change my life style</h4><p>Yesterday I have just finished my final exam which I think did pretty well. I waited nervously until midnight and the marks came out for three of my exams. Surprisingly enoughI passed ECE318 and ECE356 which I thought I did really bad on the final exam. After realize I officially finished my 3B term I have been think about what I would like to change in my future work term as well as setting goals for myself to find a better job in the next co-op and future full-time job.</p>","more":"<h2 id=\"Eat\"><a href=\"#Eat\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Eat\"></a>Eat</h2><p>I have never had a chance to eat health. Although most of time I can make my own food, I always go for the easy way make some quick delicious but unhealthy food. My favourite food is pasta with meat and salary. I decided to change in the next 4 month. I am going to use a smoothie machine to make health vegetable and fruit smoothie. Use slow cooker to make meet and vegetable so that when I get home from work I something to eat rather than buying food from outside. My body is little bit over-weight and I think I could make it better in the next few month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Work-out\"><a href=\"#Work-out\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Work out\"></a>Work out</h2><p>I have been wanting to work out since 8 month ago. I did some running and went to some gym but I am having trouble to keep it up for more than 3 weeks. I purposely found a apartment with a free gym inside so that I wouldn’t have any excuse of not going(too cold, or money) It is easy to go to gym for two days, or even a week but in order to make some real change to my body I have to commit to myself and keep going to gym. I think I can do it</p>\n<h2 id=\"Study\"><a href=\"#Study\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Study\"></a>Study</h2><p>I am not very smart compare to many people I met in my class at UW.
